     nothing in the page to say why. The reason only appears in the SERVER log.

     production. Private-range hosts only. The 192.168.4.x entry is this Mac's
     current DHCP lease and will rot when the router hands out a different one
     — if the phone starts hanging on the loading screen again, re-check with
     `ipconfig getifaddr en0` and update this list. */
